# ML_Fundamentals

This repository documents my journey in understanding machine learning concepts, accompanied by coursework problems. The structure is inspired by and follows the content from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* by Aurélien Géron.


## Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 2**: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
    - Example: Housing price prediction
- **Chapter 3**: Classification and Model Training with Metric Interpretation
    - Example: MNIST dataset - “hello world” dataset for machine learning - consists of 70,000 small images of handwritten digits
- **Chapter 4-7**: SVM models, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning
- **Chapter 8-9**: Dimensionality Reduction and Unsupervised Learning
- **Chapter 10**: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras
- **Chapter 11**: Training Deep Neural Networks
    - Example: The CIFAR-10 dataset - consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. Reference: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
- **Chapter 16**: Natural Language Processing With RNNs And Attention
    - Example: Train an Encoder-Decoder model that can convert a date string from one format - April 22, 2019 - to another format - 2019-04-22
    - Example: Adjusting pretrained GPT2 model to generate Shakespearean text
- **Chapter 17**:Representation Learning and Generative Learning Using Autoencoders and GANs
    - Example: Use a denoise autoencoder, variational autoencoder, DCGAN, conditional GAN to conduct representational learning in CIFAR-10 dataset
