# ML_Fundamentals

This repository documents my journey in understanding machine learning concepts, accompanied by coursework problems. The structure is inspired by and follows the content from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* by Aurélien Géron.


## Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 2**: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
    - Example: Housing price prediction
- **Chapter 3**: Classification and Model Training with Metric Interpretation
    - Example: MNIST dataset - “hello world” dataset for machine learning - consists of 70,000 small images of handwritten digits
- **Chapter 4-7**: SVM models, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning
- **Chapter 8-9**: Dimensionality Reduction and Unsupervised Learning
- **Chapter 10**: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras
  


**Please Note**: The coursework and examples here are personal educational exercises. While this repository is public for sharing knowledge and learning experiences, it is not intended for direct copying or academic plagiarism. I encourage viewers to use these materials as a reference for learning and to create original work based on their understanding.
