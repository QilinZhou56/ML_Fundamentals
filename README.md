This repository documents my journey in understanding machine learning concepts, accompanied by coursework problems. The structure is inspired by and follows the content from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* by Aurélien Géron.


## Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 2**: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
    - Example: Housing price prediction

**Please Note**: The coursework and examples here are personal educational exercises. While this repository is public for sharing knowledge and learning experiences, it is not intended for direct copying or academic plagiarism.
